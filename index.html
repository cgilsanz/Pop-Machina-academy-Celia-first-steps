  <h3>Pop Machina Academy Week 2: Design a logo for your Circular Maker Space</h3>
  
 <p>In order to design the logo for the Circular Maker Space of Santander:</p>
 <p> 1.	First, I made a freehand sketch with the idea I had in my head. Something related to the official brand of the city of Santander,the type of official logo, the colours etc and the idea of circularity. </p>

  <p>the official colors of the city of Santander:</p>

 <p>2.	Then use something as simple as MS Word to make different sketches repeatedly with the computer. </p>

  <P> and of course there are differents versions comming from the same idea...<p/>

 <p>3.	Once I got the sketch I like the most, I chose the inkscape program from the list to make it, since it is a new program and I am interested in learning. </p>
