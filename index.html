  <h3>Pop Machina Academy Week 1: Building a Personal Website </h3>

  <h3>Pop Machina Academy Week 2: Design a logo for your Circular Maker Space</h3>
  
   <p>In order to design the logo for the Circular Maker Space of Santander:</p>
   <p> 1.	First, I made a freehand sketch with the idea I had in my head. Something related to the official brand of the city of Santander,the type of official logo, the colours etc and the idea of circularity. </p>
     <img width="300" alt="PMEU" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cgilsanz/testing/master/BOCETO.jpg">
     <p>the official colors of the city of Santander:</p>
     <img width="300" alt="PMEU" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cgilsanz/testing/master/COLORES%20SDR.jpg">

   <p>2.	Then use something as simple as MS Word to make different sketches repeatedly with the computer. </p>
      <img width="300" alt="PMEU" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cgilsanz/testing/master/Logo%20SCMS4.jpg">
      <P> and of course there are differents versions comming from the same idea...<p/>
      <img width="300" alt="PMEU" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cgilsanz/testing/master/Logo%20SCMS8.jpg">
   <p>3.	Once I got the sketch I like the most, I chose the inkscape program from the list to make it, since it is a new program and I am interested in learning. </p>

     <p>  We ran out of chocolate but we have learned to make molds and we are going to use them to decorate the next birthday cake.....  </p> 
    
    <h3>Pop Machina Academy Week 4: Communities </h3>
  <h6>  what is a circular maker community ? </h6>
     <p>  For me, a community is a group of people who share similar or complementary concerns and interests. </p>
     <p> Therefore, a circular community is a community whose members have concerns related to the different concepts that encompass the circular economy, such as reuse, recycling, responsible consumption repair, responsible production and so on </p>   
     <h6> Regarding a circular Communities, we can star at home... </h6>    
       
     <p>At home we live 5 people, two adults and 3 children plus 2 birds, 3 cats and a dog, </p>
     <p>so weekly only packaging waste we fill between 2 and 3 bags of 15 liters capacity as you see in the picture below: </p>   
     <h6> Here you can see the plastics my familly consumes in 1 week! </h6>
