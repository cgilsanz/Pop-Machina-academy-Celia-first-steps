  <h1>Weekly Assignement</h1>
  <h3>Week 2</h3>
  
  <p>In order to design the logo for the Circular Maker Space of Piraeus I used as reference the original logo of the Municipality</p>
  
   <img width="300" alt="PMEU" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66677210/84958442-0c26a200-b106-11ea-8413-146bc34a8e04.jpg">
  
  <p>Since in many applications both logos are going to be used together I priotirised their visual balance along with maintaining the 
    general image of the municipality. The original logo has a deformed circle as border which illustrates directly the idea of closed system. </p>

       <p>Fonts where chosen in order to serve this idea of the circle and soft edges. Both fonts should accentuate the new area the municipality is 
  entering as well as underline its historical importance throughout the years.</p>
