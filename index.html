<h1 style="color:#090A85";>Â¡Hola a todos!   Greetings from Santander! </h1>
<p>  My name is Celia.</p>
<p> Welcome to the repository, here you can find my experiences in Pop Machina Academy </p> 
<p>I am working in the innovation area of the Santander City Council, Spain.  I am part of Santander POP MACHINA team.</p>
<p>I am going to try to follow the POP MACHINA training in spite of not being able to dedicate as much time as I would like.</p>
<p>My friends describe me as an enthusiastic person, I consider myself a curious person who likes to learn a little bit of everything
and above all I like to connect with people.</p>

  <h3 style="color:#098527";> Pop Machina Academy Week 1: Building a Personal Website  </h3>
  <p> As this is the first time I have created a website, I have followed all the steps indicated in the guide and I have been able to create something very simple. <p>
  <p> After the first week at the Pop machina academy, I used the "inspiration" method from another partner to improve my website and I used the github option to use another website as a template and customize the website with my stories. <p>
 
  <h3 style="color:#098527";> Pop Machina Academy Week 2: Design a logo for your Circular Maker Space </h3>
   <p> In order to design the logo for the Circular Maker Space of Santander:</p>
   <p> 1.	First, I made a freehand sketch with the idea I had in my head. Something related to the official brand of the city of Santander,the type of official logo, the colours etc and the idea of circularity. </p>

     <p>the official colors of the city of Santander:</p>
     <img width="300" alt="PMEU" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cgilsanz/testing/master/COLORES%20SDR.jpg">

   <p>2.	Then use something as simple as MS Word to make different sketches repeatedly with the computer. </p>
      <img width="300" alt="PMEU" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cgilsanz/testing/master/Logo%20SCMS4.jpg">
      <P> and of course there are differents versions comming from the same idea...<p/>
      <img width="300" alt="PMEU" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cgilsanz/testing/master/Logo%20SCMS8.jpg">
   <p>3.	Once I got the sketch I like the most, I chose the inkscape program from the list to make it, since it is a new program and I am interested in learning. </p>

    <h3 style="color:#098527";> Pop Machina Academy Week 4: Communities </h3>
  <h6>  what is a circular maker community ? </h6>
     <p>  For me, a community is a group of people who share similar or complementary concerns and interests. </p>
     <p> Therefore, a circular community is a community whose members have concerns related to the different concepts that encompass the circular economy, such as reuse, recycling, responsible consumption repair, responsible production and so on </p>   
     <h6> Regarding a circular Communities, we can star at home... </h6>    
       
     <p>At home we live 5 people, two adults and 3 children plus 2 birds, 3 cats and a dog,so weekly only packaging waste we fill between 2 and 3 bags of 15 liters capacity as you see in the picture below: </p>   
          <h6> Here you can see the "domestic recycling point"  </h6>

          <h6> Usually my family consumes in a week two full bags (15l) like you can see in the picture of the yellow container </h6>
