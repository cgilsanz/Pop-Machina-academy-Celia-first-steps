<h1>Â¡Hola a todos!   Greatings from Santander! </h1>
<p> My name is Celia.</p>
<p>I am working in the innovation area of the Santander City Council, Spain.  I am part of Santander POP MACHINA team.</p>
<p>I am going to try to follow the POP MACHINA training in spite of not being able to dedicate as much time as I would like.</p>
<p>My friends describe me as an enthusiastic person, I consider myself a curious person who likes to learn a little bit of everything
and above all I like to connect with people.</p>

  <h1>Weekly Assignement</h1>
  <h3>Pop Machina Academy Week 2: Design a logo for your Circular Maker Space</h3>
  
 <p>In order to design the logo for the Circular Maker Space of Santander:</p>
 <p> 1.	First, I made a freehand sketch with the idea I had in my head. Something related to the official brand of the city of Santander,the type of official logo, the colours etc and the idea of circularity. </p>
 <img width="300" alt="PMEU" src="https://github.com/cgilsanz/testing/blob/master/Logo%20SCMSfinal.jpg">
  
 <p>2.	Then use something as simple as MS Word to make different sketches repeatedly with the computer. </p>
  
    # <img width="600" alt="PMEU" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/xxxx.jpg">
 <p>3.	Once I got the sketch I like the most, I chose the inkscape program from the list to make it, since it is a new program and I am interested in learning. </p>
